Known Issues
============

* SkadaCCTracker doesn't correctly recognize CC events which are cast out of combat. This may be a limitation of Skada, or just my understanding on how Skada works. Working to fix this on top priority
* SkadaCCTracker doesn't use Skada's "Merge Pets" option correctly
* Pet merging in general requires some work

Credits
=======

* [Zarnivoop](http://www.wowace.com/profiles/Zarnivoop/) for the excellent Skada Damage Meter
* [0wn3d](http://www.wowace.com/profiles/0wn3d/) for RecountCC, which inspired me to create SkadaCCTracker after switching over to Skada. The list of CC spells has also been shamelessly stolen from RecountCC =)
