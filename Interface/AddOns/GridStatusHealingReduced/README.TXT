Description
-----------

GridStatusHealingReduced adds two statuses to Grid. One activates when
a unit is affected by any debuff which reduces healing taken. The other
activates for any debuff which completely prevents healing taken.


Usage
-----

The statuses added by GridStatusHealingReduced are called “Healing
Reduced” and “Healing Prevented”. They are configurable in all the usual
ways — such as color and priority — and can be placed on any indicator,
including those added by other plugins. Configuration is available
through the Grid options menu.
