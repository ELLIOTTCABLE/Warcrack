====WhisperTarget====

Addon inspired by the lack of a slash command to do it.


Description:
WhisperTarget is a lightweight, standalone addon granting you a new slash command: /wt
Simply put, it whispers the message afterwards to your current target, alerting you if you don't have one.

Example:
/wt This message will be sent to my target.


With v2.0, WhisperTarget now grants two new commands:
/wf This message will be sent to my focus.
/wm This message will be sent to my mouseover.

v2.0 also finally includes the long-missing checks to see if your appropriate recipient is actually a player, and isn't an enemy.
