Ignore this repository. Just using it to version my World of Warcraft interface settings, because I’m a fucking
lazy-ass. Feel free to steal the .gitignore if you want to do the same thing. Just make sure you log out and
commit every time you change even the smallest setting in WoW, or create a new character, or update an addon …

You get the idea.
