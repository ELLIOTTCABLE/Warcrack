### Version 6.0.3.1710

* Temporary fix for raid difficulty detection: LFR, Normal, and Heroic will use your chosen "Flexible Raid" layout, and Mythic will use your "25 Player Raid" layout. In the near future, all built-in layouts will automatically adjust their size for your current raid, and there will only be one "Raid" layout setting.
* Fixed an issue with right-click bindings in Clique (ticket #747)
* Fixed the Mouseover status not triggering when "Show Tooltip" was set to "Never" (ticket #770)
* Fixed another issue with status counts (eg. aura stacks) (ticket #768)
* Fixed the Resurrection status (ticket #745)

#### Known Issues

* WoW is currently reporting incoming heal and absorb amounts that are much too small, so Grid will also show incoming heal and absorb amounts that are much too small. There is nothing I can do about this other than wait for Blizzard to fix the problem on their end.
