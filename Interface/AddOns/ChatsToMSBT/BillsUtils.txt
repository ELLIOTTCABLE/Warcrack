Bill's Utils 
Doc Ver 3/1/2013

Bill's Utils is a library of functions that allows you to do some complex tasks with a bit of ease.
Check out Achievement Sounds and my other Addons to get real world usages of the library or look
below on what the library does and a general how to.

Just load BULoader.lua in your toc before your addon files and then all you have to do is make a local
variable to reference the function(s) you want to use and the update function to update the used functions
to to a higher version if an updated Bill's Utils is loaded after your addon loads. This helps reduce the
memory used when multiple versions of the library are used as you dereference the out of date functions so
they can be garbage collected by WoW.

Something like the following will work fine in your addon

-- Bill's Utils
local Wait = BillsUtils.Wait
local ChkBoxSave = BillsUtils.ChkBoxSave
local SliderSave = BillsUtils.SliderSave
local SliderMW = BillsUtils.SliderMW
local ChkBox = BillsUtils.ChkBox 
local CheckClick = BillsUtils.CheckClick
local Slider = BillsUtils.Slider
local SliderEditBox = BillsUtils.SliderEditBox
local EditBox = BillsUtils.EditBox

BillsUtils.Locals[#BillsUtils.Locals +1] = function ()
	Wait = BillsUtils.Wait
	ChkBoxSave = BillsUtils.ChkBoxSave
	SliderSave = BillsUtils.SliderSave
	SliderMW = BillsUtils.SliderMW
	ChkBox = BillsUtils.ChkBox
	CheckClick = BillsUtils.CheckClick
	Slider = BillsUtils.Slider
	SliderEditBox = BillsUtils.SliderEditBox
	EditBox = BillsUtils.EditBox
end


No changes to BULoader.lua are required.
