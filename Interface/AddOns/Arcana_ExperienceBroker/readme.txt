Prerequisites:
- You will need a Broker Display addon (ex: DockingStation, ChocolateBar, Fortress) to see this addon.

Installation:
- Unzip Arcana_ExperienceBroker.zip
- Copy the Arcana_ExperienceBroker folder into your World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons folder

- I wanted an addon that displayed my current percentage into level, my rest XP, and on mouseover, details about
  my XP rates. I really liked FuBar_ExperienceFu but there was no equivalent for Broker. I based this addon's
  features heavily around FuBar_ExperienceFu's layout.
