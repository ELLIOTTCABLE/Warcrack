Broker_Bags is a very simple LibDataBroker (aka LDB) plugin that shows your bag information. It will not display anything by itself and requires an LDB display like NinjaPanel or Fortress to display anything.

It provides a simple text display like this: "25/64" that shows used/total. Clicking on the panel toggles your default bags. On mouse rollover, a tooltip is displayed that shows the same display for all of your toons on that realm.

Broker_Bags excludes ammo/shard bags since that is well covered by other LDB plugins like StatBlock_Ammo.
