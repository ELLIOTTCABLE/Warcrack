Changelog for TopFit
====================

4.0v2 - 2010/12/09
  - updated toc version
  - dual wield and titan's grip should be detected correctly again - if for some class it isn't, tell me, please
  - spririt-to-hit talents for priests, shamans, druids and paladins will internally add hit rating to an item's score as a hotfix for calculating correct hit rating caps - again, if it doesn't work for a class, I will need a notice from you

4.0v1 - 2010/12/04
  - compatible with WoW 4.0.3
  - reforged stats should be recognized correctly
  - mastery rating added to stats
  - armor penetration, attack power, defense rating and block value removed from stats
  - localization support, though only english locale exists for now (thanks to ckaotik)
  - module tabs have been made prettier (thanks to ckaotik)
  - a module for importing and exporting pawn strings has been added (thanks to ckaotik) it also shows gearscore of the selected set
  - gem stats have been updated (thanks to ckaotik, once again!)
  - enchant stats have been updated
  - some cataclysm enchants and gems have been included (those that were on WoWHead already)
  - updated presets to use the current values from wowhead (though they are not very good, especially concerning the changes to spirit for all casters - they just added mastery rating at 10 value, and kept all other stats the same from WoW 3.3)
  - presets currently have no caps assigned, since I don't know the current values
  - added arms warrior preset
  - removed blood DPS and frost tank presets for death knights
  - when creating or renaming sets, TopFit will now make sure set names are always unique

3.3v6 - 2010/08/21
  - fixed items with the same itemID showing up multiple times in the force item menu
  - fixed forced slots not being correctly updated when adding or deleting a set in the options frame
  - fixed bug when trying to calculate blood tank preset. Again, if you get an error with it from before this version, click the defense cap value, and overwrite it with <Enter>
  - Deathknights can now Dualwield. D'oh
  - Added first parts of plugin API. Documentation can be found at http://github.com/Mirroar/TopFit/wiki/API
  - Stats / Caps editor and virtual items UI use the new plugin functions.
  - Virtual items can now be included in set calculation, to see what would happen if you had a certain item. Items are not sanitized (you can calculate with a level 80 item or a plate item as a level 70 priest) and any calculation including virtual items will result in the set not being equipped.
  - Shamans and Warriors can now choose to simulate dual wielding or Titan's Grip for a set, indifferent of their current spec.

3.3v5 - 2010/07/17
  - fixed a bug with the preset protection paladin set - if you stil get an error calculating that set, update the defense cap value and it should work
  - fixed a bug where you could not select item sets as values to add
  - added a tooltip to TopFit's button in the character frame
  - automatic set update will now also happen on level up (to equip items you previosly could not because of level)

  - items will no longer be tried to be equipped while you are dead
  - fixed scrollbars in options frame... again
  - the options frame will now move to the top level of the UI when you click it
  - you can now exclude individual sets from item tooltips (useful if you have multiple sets for different hitcaps, for example)

3.3v5 beta - 2010/06/24
  - items will no longer be equipped while you are in combat
  - item information is now properly cached, resulting in a performance increase
  - looking at the tooltip for an item that is not yet in the client's itemCache should no longer cause an error
  - comparing with items from your sets that are not in the client's itemCache should no longer cause an error
  - comparison tooltips for weapons expanded - comparison of two-handed weapons with one-hand + off-hand combinations should be greatly improved

  - Binds-on-Equip-Items will no longer be included in set calculations - bind the item first if you intend to use it
