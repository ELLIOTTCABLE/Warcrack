* Fixed a bunch of leaked globals through the original hooks (Oooops)
* Fixed scroll bar not appearing if you open a really large achievement like Loremaster
* Changed border handling slightly, mousing over a selected achievement will show the normal highlight color to make it obvious you mouse overed it

r1012 | shadowed.wow | 2008-11-12 11:22:21 -0800 (Wed, 12 Nov 2008) | 7 lines

* Changed achievement border if it's completed, just uses the grey border now instead of red
* Changed the background for unexpandable (Is that a word?) so you have a visual queue that yes you clicked on this, no you won't see anything extra
* Fixed sizing for meta achievements with a reward + a line of text
* Fixed sizing for 3 lines of text + reward, will now "fake" an expand so you see 2 lines of text until it's expanded
* Fixed scroll bar issues with achievements, it won't jump around and it'll actually look normal now (I am king of awesome!)
* Fixed description resizing so it's more consistent and looks good
* Fixed you being unable to uncheck a tracked quest after it's completed (If it's tracked and completed, the check box shows until it's untracked)

* Added searching of achievements in, this isn't 100% exact, in that the scrolling is a tad messed up. I'll deal with it later, not a high priority thought.
