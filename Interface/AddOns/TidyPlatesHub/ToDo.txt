6.2
* Spell Cast Monitor name search will now strip the "-" from the combat log name, which should fix PvP cast association issues.
* Debuff Widget will now strip the "-" from combat log events, which should fix pvp association issues
* fixed a 'nil' error during pet/tank association
* "Avoid Overlap" has been updated for the new CVar types
* TextPlates
* Style Mode, By Player, By Marked, By Elite

6.2.1:
- Neon and Grey were not meant to show guild names (yet), so that's been removed.  (It will come back, but only when I have a UI option)
- added "marked" condition to the "By Active" style mode
- "No Overlap" removed from Panel.  Please see "Interface > Names> Nameplate Motion" from now on.
- Changed text in a few spots
- SetCustomText can now accept RGBA colors (but it's not required)...  return string, r, g, b, a
- Text Plate for Quatre will show the supplemental text with 70% opacity
- Fixed Damage Hub Vertical position sensitivity
- Removed force-enable of aggro detection.  First-runs and resets will still enable aggro detect.

6.2.x:
- Integrate TidyPlatesIcon into core
- Graphite into Hub
- 4.2 Changes
- Friendly and Enemy Automation; In Combat, Out of Combat, Always
- move auto-enable warnings to "first time run" block
.... Future...

6.3
Name Text, Reaction Color; Greyish red for very low level, medium red for tough, Bright red for skull
Make sure Debuff Widget is clearing itself
Debuff Widget should cache debuff data on the Icon table/frames
Reduce Double Calls / reduce context update load
Check for table leaks from Core to Hub, and Core internal
Polish Slider Ranges in Hub (Some don't need to have quite so much range)
Enhance Opacity Range accuracy (Opacity seems to be on a logarythmic scale, where getting closer to 0% does less)
	- ex. Opactiy = (1-OpacitySlider)
Debuff Priority (based on height in list)
? Graphite integrated into Hub

* Allow unit.guid to be fed from another source:
	- if unit.guid then GUID[unit.guid] = plate end
	This should go in the OnUpdateNameplate function, I think:
	- if not GUID[unit.guid] then GUID[unit.guid] = plate; ContextUpdate end
* Platelevels for plates(1-100), targets(127), casters(101-120), other?(121-125)

6.1 Revisions
................................................................................................................................

6.1.3	- Welcome 
6.1.4	- Colors reset, Welcome fix
6.1.5	- Raid Tank Coloring for "By Threat" Modes
		- Alphabetized List
		- Better handling when previous theme selection does not exist
		- Debuffs of the same spell-id are now handled more securely
		
6.1.6
		- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE
		- Added Threat Wheel to Hub
		- Reverted to original health % mode (does not show % when full health)
		- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (works on 4.0.x and 4.1)
	

6.1.7
	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)
	
6.1.8
	- PTR bug fixes (Neon Threat Glow was turning green)
	- Debuff widget will clear aurainstance tables when combat ends (regen returns)
	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)

6.1.11
	NEW! Keyword filtering for the Debuff Widget
	- See Demo on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KjGFd0TgvM
	- By Prefix.. Mode for Debuff Widget
		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"
		
	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale

6.1.12
	- Fixed Hub/Tank NameTextColor errors
	- Updated description of "Vertical Position of Frame" to "Vertical Position of Artwork"

6.1.13
	- tweaked name color function
	- Debug widget should clear its cache more often
	
6.2 Beta
	- New Section in Hub: Style
