- Changed colors of subtitles to blue. Suggested by Telchar.
- NOTE: The "Quest finished" checkboxes for Blackrock Depths will be slightly off now since I added the kill quests for Overmaster Pyron. For Alliance, Quests 5 through 16. For Horde, Quests 11 through 16.

	- Botanica: Master of Potions (Alchemy)
	- Black Morass: Master of Elixirs (Alchemy)
	- Blackrock Depths: Overmaster Pyron (from Celellach)
	- Blackrock Depths: Disharmony of Flame (from Celellach)

- Minor Code Changes:

	- Atlas now listed as "Optional" Dependency so AlphaMap users can use AtlasQuest. Reported by qwegg.
	- Color codes for "No Reward" and "Reward" text moved to localization file since color codes for similar text strings are there.
	- Moved AtlasQuest version string into AtlasQuest.lua. Constants.lua is now obsolete. Will probably keep it around for now though.


Version 4.0.6 (August 28, 2007)

- Added 3 quests for Black Temple (missing some info though)
- Various fixes to quests thanks to Celellach and SaiBork.
- Quests added:
	- Deadmines: The Unsent Letter (drops off VanCleef)  (from Celellach)
	- Black Temple: Seek Out the Ashtongue
	- Black Temple: Redemption of the Ashtongue
	- Black Temple: The Fall of the Betrayer

- Fixing up old dungeon quests, verifying/adding data, adding Entrance Map info where needed.
	- Deadmines completed.
	- Wailing Caverns completed.
	- Ragefire Chasm completed.
	- Uldaman completed.
- In cases where the Horde and Alliance have the same quest info, I'm now having the Horde version refer (via code) to the Alliance version. I think it was Lothaer that started doing this with the BC quests. Seems like a good idea and it'll save time for any translators down the road.
- Using two decimals in version number now, like Atlas and AtlasLoot use.
