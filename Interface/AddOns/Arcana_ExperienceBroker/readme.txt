Arcana's Experience Broker by Arcana
October 2010


Prerequisites:
- You will need a Broker Display addon (ex: DockingStation, ChocolateBar, Fortress) to see this addon.

Installation:
- Unzip Arcana_ExperienceBroker.zip
- Copy the Arcana_ExperienceBroker folder into your World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons folder

v40000.3.1.0: 2010-11-20

- Added percentages in the tooltip

v40000.3.0.1: 2010-10-14

- Minor bug fixes

v40000.3: 2010-10-13

- Updated addon for compatibility with 4.0
- Added a "Time to level" display on the toolbar (click the text four times to show it!)

v0.2: 2010-07-16

v0.1: 2009-09-12

- I wanted an addon that displayed my current percentage into level, my rest XP, and on mouseover, details about
  my XP rates. I really liked FuBar_ExperienceFu but there was no equivalent for Broker. I based this addon's
  features heavily around FuBar_ExperienceFu's layout.
