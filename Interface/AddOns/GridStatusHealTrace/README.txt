Features
--------

GridStatusHealTrace adds a status to Grid to show you who was just
healed by your multi-target healing spells.

By default, it traces healing from Chain Heal, Circle of Healing, Divine
Hymn, Holy Nova, and Light of Dawn. You can add other heals to trace in
the status menu, under Grid > Status > Heal trace > Add new spell.

GridStatusHealTrace is loosely based on the old GridStatusChainWho by
Llyra, but it can be shown on icon indicators, it doesn’t show crits
separately, and the spells are configurable.


Localization
------------

GridStatusHealTrace is compatible with English, Deutsch, Español,
Français, Português, Русский, 한국어, 简体中文, and 正體中文 clients.

GridStatusHealTrace is translated into English, Español, and Português.

If you can provide translations for any locale, please send me a PM, or
enter them using the CurseForge localization system:
