Minimap Button Frame v3.0 Readme.txt

Installation is the same as it is for most other WoW addons.  
Unpack the files to your  Worldofwarcraft/Interface/Addons   directory.


This addon will gather up most of your minimap addon buttons and put them into a movable frame.

If a button is not automatically gathered use the /mbf add command to attempt to gather it.
If you want to remove a button from the frame use the /mbf remove command to remove it.  
If you would like to return it to the frame just use /mbf add on the button.

MBF Will not gather buttons the do not have a name.  Currently I have only discovered two addons that create their minimap buttons this way.
OnRaid and Enchantrix.

Blizzard minimap buttons that are not always visible (Battleground, LFG) will only appear on the frame when they are normally shown.

Key Bindings can be setup for both add and remove as well as for hiding and showing the frame.

The Minimap Icons and Button Override settings are more advanced features.  
The Minimap Icons setting is for icons such as the nodes in GatherMate and gatherer that shouldn't be collected.
The Button Override is for buttons that will not gather automatically and a manual add gives the "Cannot add.  Protected or already included!" error.

Commands:

   /mbf			- displays the command line options in the chat frame
   /mbf add <button>	- adds a non gathered button to the frame.  <button> is optional.  
			  If it's not included then the item under the cursor will be gathered.
   /mbf remove <button> - removes a gathered button from the frame.  <button> is optional.  
			  If it's not included then the item under the cursor is removed.
   /mbf show		- shows the Main MBF Frame
   /mbf hide		- hides the Main MBF Frame
   /mbf info		- shows information about the object under the cursor
   /mbf config		- shows the configuration screen
   /mbf help		- shows command help and information

Minimap Button:

<Left-click>           - to show / hide the frame and all the buttons.
<Shift-click>          - to show the config screen.
<Right-click> and drag - to move the minimap button anywhere.

Known Incompatibilities / Bugs

	The MetaMap minimap button is incompatable because of the continual reseting of its position by the MetaMap addon.
	SexyMap must have all minimap icon control turned off for best results.  Though it still seems to mess with them.

	The addon is unable grab minmap buttons that do not have a name.
	Currently discovered addons that are this way are:

		Enchantrix 	( I have had a change request in with the developers for a while.  I don't think they're going to fix this. )
		onRaid


Future Features

	Ability to change the color of the border.
