Missing Friends
---------------
"Friend removed because the character no longer exists."
Most people has probably seen this message pop up in their chat window upon login, and you always wonder, who was it?!

What this addon does, is to make a copy of your friend list. When you login and recieve the friend removed message,
it will then compare your copied friend list with the server friend list, then notify you of anyone who has gone missing.

There is a slash command "/mf" which will list all the friends lost over time.

Thanks to Ferylin who forced me to write this addon at gunpoint, and wouldn't let me go until I was done :(
