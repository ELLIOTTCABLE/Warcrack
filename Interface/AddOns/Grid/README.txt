# <a>&#65517;</a> What is Grid?

**<big>Grid is a compact and highly configurable party/raid unit frame addon.</big>**

The compact grid of units lets you select a group member quickly, while keeping a good overview of the whole group. It shows as much information as possible without overloading you. It allows you to customize what information you see, and how you see it. It works in both party and raid groups, and supports pets and vehicles.

**Want more features?** The Grid core tries to include only features which are generally useful for all classes and roles, but makes it easy to add new features with a simple plugin API for developers. [Over 75 plugins] [4] are already available!

# <a>&#65517;</a> How to use Grid

To open the options window, type &#8220;``/grid``&#8221;, right-click the tab on the Grid layout frame, or right-click the Grid icon on your minimap or DataBroker display.

Because Grid is so configurable, its options can be confusing at first. We recommend taking a few minutes to look through all of the options before asking for help. There is a small in-game Help section in the options panel, and also a small [User&#8217;s Guide] [5] that may be helpful in explaining some of the terms used in Grid, like *status*, *indicator*, and *priority*.
