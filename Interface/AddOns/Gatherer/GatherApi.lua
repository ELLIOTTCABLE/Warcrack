-- This function can be used as an interface by other addons to record things
-- in Gatherer's database, though display is still based only on what is defined
-- in Gatherer items and icons tables.
-- Parameters:
--   objectId (number): the object id for this node (from Gatherer.Nodes)
--   gatherType (string): gather type (Mine, Herb, Skin, Fish, Treasure)
--   indoorNode (boolean or number): whether the node is an indoor node (as determined by the minimap), should be a number of a micro-dungeon floor if inside a microdungeon
--   gatherSource (string): the name of the sender (or nil if you collected it)
--   gatherCoins (number): amount of copper found in the node
--   gatherLoot (table): a table of loot: { { link, count }, ...}
--   wasGathered (boolean): was this object actually opened by the player
