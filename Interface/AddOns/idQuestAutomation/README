This addon automatically accepts all quests from an NPC and completes all
quests that you can complete. In case a reward needs to be chosen it will not
complete the quest so you can choose.

Features
  - Accepts all new quests.
  - Completes quests when there is no reward to be chosen, then accepts a
    followup quest if there is one.
  - Will not automate when holding shift.
