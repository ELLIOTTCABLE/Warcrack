--------------------

Infus:
	- OptionsDialog: Sort the buttons delayed
	If a event happened and the options window is hidden.
	
	Ticket-number: 251
	- Combat Log trigger: Check destUnit via GUID instead of destName
	That should be more reliable and fixes:
	
	Ticket-Number: 311
	- Don't restart models on each WORLD_MAP_UPDATE
	This breaks with NPCScan.Overlay installed. Instead hook into
	the world map hide function. As that is where we need to reset
	the models.
	- ConstructFunction: Simplify interface
	- Remove unused parameters subPrefix and subEvent
	
	  The function doesn't use those parameters, so remove them from all
	  callers. Also removes some special handling for the combat log trigger.
	
	- Pass in the trigger table directly
	  Instead of data, triggernum and the field.
	- Text: Check that the font was set before SetText
	Ticket-number: 305
Benjamin Staneck:
	- avoid two division by zero errors on the PTR
	- revert font change, will now use your custom font again
Infus:
	- Pet Behavior trigger: Fix to changes in WoD
	Don't stop at a empty button and active is a bool now.
	- Auracache: Key it on the aura id and not on the auraname
	Otherwise the count condition of two auras that check for
	the same auraname gets confussed.
	
	Ticket-Number: 281
	- Progress Bar: Add zoom option
	Because the icon has it and it's easy to add. Not particular
	useful..
	- Progress Bar: Hide icon color if icon is deselected
	- Text: Check that the font was set before SetText
	Ticket-number: 305
Benjamin Staneck:
	- revert compat removal
	- whitespace change to pull updated translations.
	- remove some MoP compat, rename Encounter ID list translation entry and translate "Encounter ID" maybe the CurseForge translation system likes to pick up the changes this time...
	- remove comment
	- convert indenting to what is used in the files (spaces - sigh) and localize the encounter id tooltip values, see http://www.wowace.com/addons/weakauras-2/localization/phrases/1144-current-encounter-ids/ if you want to help translate it, not sure this is the best way to do that but it will have to do for now.
Tercioo:
	- Ticket #4 - Load Condition on ENCOUNTER_START
	Add an extra option on Load panel to type the Encounter ID.
	Tracks ENCOUNTER_START/END to load and unload the aura, also has
	protection agaisnt disconnect and combat leave by zone change.
Tzarc:
	- Add aura ID to the aura_env table.
